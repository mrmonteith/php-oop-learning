# Design Patterns

## 📘 Overview
This section contains examples of common object‑oriented design patterns implemented in PHP.  
Each pattern includes:

- One or more PHP classes
- A runnable `example.php`
- A focused `README.md` explaining the pattern

These examples are intentionally simple and clear, making them ideal for learning and reference.

## 📂 Patterns Included

- **Singleton** — Ensure only one instance of a class exists  
- **Factory** — Create objects without exposing creation logic  
- **Strategy** — Swap algorithms at runtime  
- **Observer** — Notify multiple objects when something changes  

More patterns can be added over time.

## ▶️ Running
Each pattern folder contains its own `example.php`.  
Start your PHP server and visit the example directly:

```

```
