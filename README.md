# PHP OOP Learning Repository

This repository is a structured, web‑runnable collection of examples demonstrating modern PHP Object‑Oriented Programming concepts.  
Each topic is isolated in its own folder with:

- One or more PHP classes
- A runnable `example.php`
- A focused `README.md` explaining the concept

This project is designed for clarity, modularity, and real‑world learning — and doubles as a portfolio piece showing clean architecture and progressive mastery.
