# PHP OOP Learning Repository

## 📘 Overview
This repository is a structured, web‑runnable collection of examples demonstrating modern PHP Object‑Oriented Programming concepts.  
It is designed for clarity, modularity, and real‑world learning — and doubles as a portfolio piece showing clean architecture and progressive mastery.

Each topic is isolated in its own folder with:
- One or more PHP classes  
- A runnable `example.php`  
- A focused `README.md` explaining the concept  

Every file includes a header with file name, description, date created, and author.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/php-oop-learning.git
   ```
2. Start a local PHP server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```
3. Open in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

Most standalone examples can also be run directly:

```bash
php example.php
```
